# NLPProject

Here we have the code to test the accuracies and recall for four intent classification models: Convolutional Neural Network, BERT, Multi
Layer Perceptron and Dialogflow.


CNN: Convolutional Neural Network is known for its edge case detectability and with poper assignement of hyperparameters we can achive the best accuracy. The above file CNN.ipynb can be used for all the datasets and parameters are to be tuned for each dataset.

Dialogflow: project_agent is a basic dialogue flow agent. data should be imported to the agent and then it can be used for intent recognition.
